# Wannier2022
This is a repository to develop tutorial at he Wannier2022 summer school in Trieste.

I started `basic` in a jupiter notebook, what do oyu think

Note: before commiting, clear the outputs of the notebooks :


```
jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace tutorial-wb-basic.ipynb 

```

## Guidlines for tutorials
Each tutorial is written as a Jupyter notebook. To run the jupyter notebook, copy the tutorial directory
to your folder, go to that folder, and run the following codes:
```python3
workon base
jupyter notebook
```

Advanced users who are already familiar with the WannierBerri code may try the advanced tutorials.
There are several advanced topics, one per each folder in the advanced/ directory.
You may try to follow the guides in the notebook. If you have completed the tutorial, you
may compare your code and results with those in the solution/ folder.
